# Foundations of Data Science
21HS MINF4566 Foundations of Data Science (L+E) course

We had to do three practical projects during the course on the following topics:
- Practical Task 1: Implementation of Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso)
  - implement the linear model from scratch using the numpy package
  - use learning curves plot to understand whether the linear model is overfitting or underfitting
  -  implement linear models with polynomial basis expansions and regularizations (Ridge and Lasso) by making use of scikit-learn
  -  use k-fold cross validation to obtain the optimal hyper-parameters for the models
- Practical Task 2: Generative and Discriminative Models
  - compare the Naïve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression on two different datasets
  - reproduce some of the experimental results in this paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020-on-discriminative-vs-generative-classifiers-a-comparison-of-logistic-regression-and-naive-bayes.pdf
  - implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier from scratch using NumPy
  - analyse and preprocess the given datasets using Pandas and reproduce the experiment on the datasets
- Practical Task 3: Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning
  - build convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow and Keras API
  - use transfer learning to build a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset
